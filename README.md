## SETTING THINGS UP

To execute the code, if you are brave enough, you need to:

 1. Clone this repository.
 2. Install Ruby in your machine.
 3. Execute the following in the terminal:
  * n is the number of the day you want to execute, for day 1, /Day_1, and so on.

 ```
 $ ruby ./Day_n/solution.rb
 ```

 And you will see the solution in all its glory.
